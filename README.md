**LAB 7:** In Lab 7, I was tasked with creating a product page that displays product information, including the product name, price, and description. The page also featured navigation options to return to the home page and view more details about each product. Despite encountering several errors and bugs during this lab, I successfully completed it. 
       Notably, this project marked my initial exposure to Razor syntax.

**LAB 9:** Lab 9 revolved around working with tools and frequently asked questions (FAQs). It presented me with the opportunity to delve into session state management for the first time, making it a valuable learning experience.

**LAB 11:** In Lab 11, we introduced a new "Events" tab that showcased upcoming events and provided information on how to participate in them.
